<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<p>Zachary David Alexander Efron (/ˈɛfrɒn/; born October 18, 1987)[2] is an American actor and singer. He began acting professionally in the early 2000s and rose to prominence in the late 2000s for his leading role as Troy Bolton in the High School Musical trilogy (2006–2008). During this time, he also starred in the musical film Hairspray (2007) and the comedy film 17 Again (2009). Efron has since starred in the films New Year's Eve (2011), The Lucky One (2012), The Paperboy (2012), Neighbors (2014), Dirty Grandpa (2016), Baywatch (2017), The Greatest Showman (2017), Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile (2019), and Scoob!

<h1>Heading 2</h1>
<p><span>Efron was born in San Luis Obispo</span>, California,[3] and later moved to Arroyo Grande, California. His father, David Efron, is an electrical engineer at a power station, and his mother, Starla Baskett, is a secretary who worked at the same power plant.[4][5] Efron has a brother, Dylan,[2] and had, as he has described, a "normal childhood" in a middle-class family.[6] His last name, "Efron" (אפרון), is a Jewish surname, taken from a Biblical place name.[7][8] Zac has described himself as Jewish,[9] though he was raised in an agnostic household and did not practice religion as a child.[10]
<p>Efron has said that he would "flip out" if he got a "B" and not an "A" in school, as well as that he was a class clown.[11] His father encouraged him to begin acting when Zac was eleven years old.[4] Efron subsequently appeared in theater productions at his high school,[12] worked in the theater The Great American Melodrama and Vaudeville,[6] and began taking singing lessons.[4] He performed in shows such as Gypsy; Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up; Little Shop of Horrors; and The Music Man. He was recommended to an agent in Los Angeles by his drama teacher, Robyn Metchik (the mother of actors Aaron Michael Metchik and Asher Metchik).[13][14] Efron was later signed to the Creative Artists Agency.[15]
</p>
<p><span>Efron graduated from Arroyo Grande High School</span> in 2006[16] and was then accepted into the University of Southern California but did not enroll. He also attended Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts, a community college located in Santa Maria, California, where he performed during the years of 2000 and 2001.[17]</p>
</p>

<h1>Heading 3</h1>
<p>Efron began acting in the early 2000s with guest roles on several television series including Firefly,[18] ER, and The Guardian. In 2004, he began appearing as a recurring character in the first season of the WB series Summerland.[19][19] For the show's second season, which aired in 2005, he was promoted to the main cast. He also appeared in some films, including the Lifetime television film Miracle Run (2004), for which he earned a Young Artist Award nomination for his performance as one of two autistic twins.</p>
<p>Efron's career reached a turning point with the teen musical television film High School Musical (2006), which premiered on the Disney Channel in January 2006. The film, which has been described as a modern adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, saw Efron playing the male lead Troy Bolton, a high school basketball player who feels conflicted when he finds himself interested in participating in the school musical with Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Hudgens), a girl from the scholastic decathlon team. The film, which also starred Ashley Tisdale, Lucas Grabeel, Corbin Bleu, and Monique Coleman in pivotal roles, became a major success and helped Efron gain recognition among teenage audiences. The film's soundtrack was certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA,[20] making it one of the best-selling albums of the year in the United States. Efron's singing talents were disputed when it was revealed that his voice had been blended with Drew Seeley's on the soundtrack, but Efron clarified that the songs (written for a tenor) were written before he was cast and therefore did not suit his more baritone vocal range. In his subsequent musical films, Efron did his own singing.</p>

In January 2016, he starred alongside Robert De Niro in the adult comedy Dirty Grandpa, about a straitlaced young man who begrudgingly indulges his grandfather's unhinged personality by taking him on a vacation to Florida.

He subsequently co-starred with Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne, and Chloë Grace Moretz in the comedy sequel Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising, which became a commercial and critical success upon its release in May 2016. The film followed the same couple (Rogen and Byrne) who team up with their former rival (Efron) to take down a hard-partying sorority led by a freshman (Moretz). His third 2016 comedy, released in July, was Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates, in which he co-starred with Adam DeVine (playing siblings), as well as Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza.
